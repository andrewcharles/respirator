A key aspect of the present SPH approach is the periodic reinitialization (remeshing) of the particle locations, which are being distorted by the flow map. High-order moment conserving kernels are being implemented for this remeshing procedure leading to accurate simulations. The accuracy of the proposed SPH methodology is tested for a number of benchmark problems involving flow and energy transport. The results demonstrate that the proposed SPH methodology is capable of DNS quality simulations while maintaining its robustness and adaptivity.},

	abstract = {A new Lagrangian sea ice model for the Arctic Ocean has been developed to accommodate the assimilation of integral measures of ice displacement over periods of days or weeks. The model is a two-layer (thick ice and open water) dynamic model with 600?700 cells spaced at roughly 100 km. The force balance equation is solved for each cell with standard wind and water stress terms, a Coriolis term, and an internal ice stress term. The internal stress is found using a viscous?plastic rheology and an elliptical yield curve. The strain rate is determined by the ?Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics? formalism, which determines the spatial derivatives of the velocity by a weighted summation of the velocities of adjacent cells. A length scale of 150 km is used. The model is driven with observed geostrophic winds and climatological-mean ocean currents. Ice growth and melt are found from a seasonal- and thickness-based lookup table because the current focus is on the model dynamics. The model ice velocity simulations are compared to observed buoy motion. Over the 5-yr period 1993?97 the correlation of the daily averaged model velocity with buoy velocities is R = 0.76 (N = 42 553, rms difference = 0.072 m s?1, speed bias = +0.009 m s?1, angle bias = 8.0?). This compares favorably with the correlation of a state-of-the-art Eulerian coupled ice?ocean model, where R = 0.74 in the summer and 0.66 in the winter over the same 5-yr period. },

	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) models were used to simulate unsaturated flow in fractures with complex geometries. The SPH is a fully Lagrangian particle-based method that allows the dynamics of interfaces separating fluids to be modeled without employing complex front tracking schemes. In SPH simulations, the fluid density field is represented by a superposition of weighting functions centered on particles which represent the fluids. The pressure is related to the fluid density through an equation of state, and the particles move in response to the pressure gradient. The SPH does not require the construction of grids that would otherwise introduce numerical dispersion. The model can be used to simulate complex free-surface flow phenomenon such as invasion of wetting and nonwetting fluids into three-dimensional fractures. These processes are a severe challenge for grid-based methods. Surface tension was simulated by using a van der Waals equation of state and a combination of short-range repulsive and longer-range attractive interactions between fluid particles. The wetting behavior was simulated using similar interactions between mobile fluid particles and stationary boundary particles. The fracture geometry was generated from self-affine fractal surfaces. The fractal model was based on a large body of experimental work, which indicates that fracture surfaces have a self-affine fractal geometry characterized by a material independent (quasi universal) Hurst exponent of about 0.75. },

Mathematical discussion of this kinetic equation, using methods and concepts of dynamical system theory, introduces naturally two quantities. One appears when discussing a special type of stationary solutions, a second when discussing their dynamic stability properties. The physical meaning of the first quantity is revealed by observing that this quantity is equivalent to the grand partition function that is known from the Van Kampen theory of an equilibrium Van der Waals gas. The second quantity is a convenient dynamical extension of this grand partition function. Assuming certain existence properties of solutions of the kinetic equation considered, it is proved that a thermodynamically stable uniform-density equilibrium state is also asymptotically stable.},

The modification consists of a straightforward adaptation of the commonly used semi-Lagrangian advection method to account for the mesh's motion. Because the method does not require more interpolation steps than standard semi-Lagrangian integration, it does not suffer from additional smoothing and requires only the added cost of updating the mesh. By specifying appropriate boundary conditions, mesh boundaries can behave like moving obstacles that act on the fluid resulting in a number of interesting effects. The paper includes several examples that have been computed on moving tetrahedral meshes.},

The objective of the theory is to derive the Fokker?Planck equation that governs the probability distribution of the coarse-grained variables. The essential practical problem of an explicit coarse-graining procedure from the microscopic dynamics, which is the high dimensionality of state space, is pinpointed. This problem enforces one to model the objects appearing in the Fokker?Planck equation. In this case, the program of coarse-graining helps in producing strong conditions on the possible forms of these objects. In particular, we review the stringent GENERIC structure that emerges when the dynamical invariants can be expressed as functions of the coarse-grained variables. Finally, we illustrate how the GENERIC framework may help in the task of inventing new discrete models for the simulation of complex fluids that are thermodynamically consistent by construction.},

	abstract = {In order to model complex heterogeneous biophysical macrostructures with non-trivial charge distributions such as globular proteins in water, it is important to evaluate the long range forces present in these systems accurately and efficiently. The Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald summation technique (SPME) is commonly used to determine the long range part of electrostatic energy in large scale molecular simulations. While the SPME technique does not give rise to a performance bottleneck on a single processor, current implementations of SPME on massively parallel, supercomputers become problematic at large processor numbers, limiting the time and length scales that can be reached. Here, a synergistic investigation involving method improvement, parallel programming and novel architectures is employed to address this difficulty. A relatively simple modification of the SPME technique is described which gives rise to both improved accuracy and efficiency on both massively parallel and scalar computing platforms. Our fine grained parallel implementation of the modified SPME method for the novel QCDOC supercomputer with its 6D-torus architecture is then given. Numerical tests of algorithm performance on up to 1024 processors of the QCDOC machine at BNL are presented for two systems of interest, a [beta]-hairpin solvated in explicit water, a system which consists of 1142 water molecules and a 20 residue protein for a total of 3579 atoms, and the HIV-1 protease solvated in explicit water, a system which consists of 9331 water molecules and a 198 residue protein for a total of 29508 atoms.},

	author = {Claude Lacoursi{\`e}re},
	year = {2007},
	note = {A time-discrete formulation of the variational principle of mechanics is used to provide a consistent theoretical framework for the construction and analysis of low order integration methods. These are applied to mechanical systems subject to mixed constraints and dry frictional contacts and impacts---machines. The framework includes physics motivated constraint regularization and stabilization schemes. This is done by adding potential energy and Rayleigh dissipation terms in the Lagrangian formulation used throughout. These terms explicitly depend on the value of the Lagrange multipliers enforcing constraints. Having finite energy, the multipliers are thus massless ghost particles. The main numerical stepping method produced with the framework is called SPOOK.Variational integrators preserve physical invariants globally, exactly in some cases, approximately but within fixed global bounds for others. This allows to product realistic physical trajectories even with the low order methods. These are needed in the solution of nonsmooth problems such as dry frictional contacts and in addition, they are computationally inexpensive. The combination of strong stability, low order, and the global preservation of invariants allows for large integration time steps, but without loosing accuracy on the important and visible physical quantities. SPOOK is thus well-suited for interactive simulations, such as those commonly used in virtual environment applications, because it is fast, stable, and faithful to the physics.New results include a stable discretization of highly oscillatory terms of constraint regularization; a linearly stable constraint stabilization scheme based on ghost potential and Rayleigh dissipation terms; a single-step, strictly dissipative, approximate impact model; a quasi-linear complementarity formulation of dry friction that is isotropic and solvable for any nonnegative value of friction coefficients; an analysis of a splitting scheme to solve frictional contact complementarity problems; a stable, quaternion-based rigid body stepping scheme and a stable linear approximation thereof. SPOOK includes all these elements. It is linearly implicit and linearly stable, it requires the solution of either one linear system of equations of one mixed linear complementarity problem per regular time step, and two of the same when an impact condition is detected. The changes in energy caused by constraints, impacts, and dry friction, are all shown to be strictly dissipative in comparison with the free system. Since all regularization and stabilization parameters are introduced in the physics, they map directly onto physical properties and thus allow modeling of a variety of phenomena, such as constraint compliance, for instance.Tutorial material is included for continuous and discrete-time analytic mechanics, quaternion algebra, complementarity problems, rigid body dynamics, constraint kinematics, and special topics in numerical linear algebra needed in the solution of the stepping equations of SPOOK.The qualitative and quantitative aspects of SPOOK are demonstrated by comparison with a variety of standard techniques on well known test cases which are analyzed in details. SPOOK compares favorably for all these examples. In particular, it handles ill-posed and degenerate problems seamlessly and systematically. An implementation suitable for large scale performance and accuracy testing is left for future work.},

Lett. 86, 2038 (2001)] a simple fluid with a particular density-dependent pair potential was shown to exhibit, together with the vapor-liquid transition, a liquid-liquid phase separation and it was evidenced that, in order to adequately define the correct boundaries of stability, a simulation procedure based on the use of local densities had to be devised. It was found that for certain thermodynamic states the potential drives the system toward a phase separation that is otherwise frustrated by the change in the interactions induced by density fluctuations. Therefore, when integral equations or global density simulations are used, the critical points estimated from the thermodynamics are not associated with divergent correlations and vice versa. Here, we will explore in depth this fluid and introduce a detailed account of the proposed local density simulation technique. The results presented bear general significance for density-dependent potentials, like those of liquid metals or charge-stabilized colloids.},

The temperature of the system is then directly related to the noise amplitude by means of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. However, the correspondingly modified, discrete DPD algorithm is only found to obey these predictions if the length of the time step is sufficiently reduced. This indicates the importance of time discretisation in DPD.},

They allow for arbitrary three-dimensional motion with self-gravity and with heating and cooling mechanisms which are appropriate to the interstellar medium. Sequences with initial chaotic motion and with associated kinetic energies which are near the virial energy have been examined. The results show that, provided the energy in chaotic motion is below the virial value, a large fraction of the matter will form clumps. Many of the clumps are rotating rapidly and form extended disc systems. The number of clumps formed is small and the free-fall time of the clumps is much less than that of the complex. The authors therefore expect star formation to occur before the initial clumps collide. They infer that once a giant cloud complex is made, its collapse is inexorable, and its fate is to be disrupted by star formation which, through winds, H II regions or supernovae, can disperse most of the gas which is not in stars.},

	abstract = {Visual accuracy, low computational cost, and numerical stability are foremost goals in computer animation. An important ingredient in achieving these goals is the conservation of fundamental motion invariants. For example, rigid or deformable body simulation have benefited greatly from conservation of linear and angular momenta. In the case of fluids, however, none of the current techniques focuses on conserving invariants, and consequently, they often introduce a visually disturbing numerical diffusion of vorticity. Visually just as important is the resolution of complex simulation domains. Doing so with regular (even if adaptive) grid techniques can be computationally delicate.In this chapter, we propose a novel technique for the simulation of fluid flows. It is designed to respect the defining differential properties, i.e., the conservation of circulation along arbitrary loops as they are transported by the flow. Consequently, our method offers several new and desirable properties: (1) arbitrary simplicial meshes (triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D) can be used to define the fluid domain; (2) the computations are efficient due to discrete operators with small support; (3) the method is stable for arbitrarily large time steps; and (4) it preserves a discrete circulation avoiding numerical diffusion of vorticity. The underlying ideas are easy to incorporate in current approaches to fluid simulation and should thus prove valuable in many applications.},

We measure vertical profiles of the bubble velocities, the bubble radii, and the liquid fraction, for four different gas fluxes. In steady state the bubbles move upwards with constant speed equal to the measured gas flux, which accounts for all transport of gas. The bubbles also coarsen by gas diffusion at a rate that depends on liquid fraction. Away from the bottom, the Plateau border radii are constant. Therefore capillary effects are negligible and the steady-state liquid-fraction profile is set chiefly by the balance of viscous forces and gravity. The flow within the Plateau borders may be modeled with a no-slip boundary condition for our system. These findings provide a simple description of steady-state foams via the coarsening and drainage equations, which can be combined and solved analytically for bubble radius and liquid-fraction profiles. },

	abstract = {Daisyworld is a simple planetary model designed to show the long-term effects of coupling between life and its environment. Its original form was introduced by James Lovelock as a defense against criticism that his Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating homeostatic system requires teleological control rather than being an emergent property. The central premise, that living organisms can have major effects on the climate system, is no longer controversial. The Daisyworld model has attracted considerable interest from the scientific community and has now established itself as a model independent of, but still related to, the Gaia theory. Used widely as both a teaching tool and as a basis for more complex studies of feedback systems, it has also become an important paradigm for the understanding of the role of biotic components when modeling the Earth system. This paper collects the accumulated knowledge from the study of Daisyworld and provides the reader with a concise account of its important properties. We emphasize the increasing amount of exact analytic work on Daisyworld and are able to bring together and summarize these results from different systems for the first time. We conclude by suggesting what a more general model of life-environment interaction should be based on.},

The phase separation is, instead, driven by the enhanced screening at higher densities, which leads to ideal-gas behaviour at sufficiently high densities. A fluid at intermediate densities can thus reduce its free energy by separating into a dilute vapour and a high-density liquid.},

The relationship of this generalized van der Waals theory to the currently popular perturbation theory for liquid-vapor surfaces is demonstrated. An application of this theory to the description of the Lennard-Jones fluid interface near the triple point is reported, and comparisons of the predictions with numerical Monte Carlo experiments are made. The generalized van der Waals theory is then used to study infinitesimal density fluctuations and their relation to the stability of the single phase fluid state and critical opalescence. Theories for describing nonequilibrium density variations in a fluid are discussed with particular emphasis on the diffusion approximation. Theoretical predictions using the generalized diffusion equation are presented and compared with a numerical molecular dynamics simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid quenched into the unstable region of the phase diagram (spinodal decomposition). Finally, a formal statistical mechanical theory for nonuniform fluids is presented and related to the van der Waals type theories.},

	abstract = {A numerical model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was developed for reactive transport and mineral precipitation in fractured and porous materials. Because of its Lagrangian particle nature, SPH has several advantages for modeling Navier-Stokes flow and reactive transport including: (1) in a Lagrangian framework there is no non-linear term in the momentum conservation equation, so that accurate solutions can be obtained for momentum dominated flows and; (2) complicated physical and chemical processes such as surface growth due to precipitation/dissolution and chemical reactions are easy to implement. In addition, SPH simulations explicitly conserve mass and linear momentum. The SPH solution of the diffusion equation with fixed and moving reactive solid-fluid boundaries was compared with analytical solutions, Lattice Boltzmann [Q. Kang, D. Zhang, P. Lichtner, I. Tsimpanogiannis, Lattice Boltzmann model for crystal growth from supersaturated solution, Geophysical Research Letters, 31 (2004) L21604] simulations and diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) [P.

	abstract = {An analytical framework is presented that permits examination of the limit to the efficiency of various solar power conversion devices. Thermodynamic limits to solar power efficiency are determined for both quantum and thermal systems, and the results are applied to a variety of devices currently considered for use in space systems. The power conversion efficiency for single-threshold energy quantum systems receiving unconcentrated air mass zero solar radiation is limited to 31 percent. This limit applies to photovoltaic cells directly converting solar radiation, or indirectly, as in the case of a thermophotovoltaic system. Photoelectrochemical cells rely on an additional chemical reaction at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, which introduces additional second-law demands and a reduction of the solar conversion efficiency. Photochemical systems exhibit even lower possible efficiencies because of their relatively narrow absorption bands. Solar-powered thermal engines in contact with an ambient reservoir at 300 K and operating at maximum power have a peak conversion efficiency of 64 percent, and this occurs for a thermal reservoir at a temperature of 2900 K. The power conversion efficiency of a solar-powered liquid metal magnetohydrodydnamic generator, a solar-powered steam turbine electric generator, and an alkali metal thermoelectric converter is discussed.},

By basing the SPH equations on the particle number density artificial surface tension effects were avoided. The simulation results for the growth of a single perturbation driven by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability compare well with numerical results obtained by Fournier et al., and the growth of a perturbation with time can be represented quite well by a second-degree polynomial, in accord with the linear stability analysis of Duff et al. The dispersion coefficient found from SPH simulation of flow and diffusion in an ideal fracture was in excellent agreement with the value predicted by the theory of Taylor and Aris. The simulations of miscible flow in fracture apertures can be used to determination dispersion coefficients for transport in fractured media - a parameter used in large-scale simulations of contaminant transport.},

	abstract = {A numerical model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was developed and used to simulate immiscible and miscible fluid flows in porous media and to study effects of pore scale heterogeneity and anisotropy on such flows. Models for heterogeneous porous media were generated by using randomly located non-intersecting circular grains of different sizes, and pore scale anisotropy was introduced by randomly inserting non-overlapping particles on either side of the gap between two self-affine fractal curves to create a microfracture. Different fluid wetting behaviors and surface tensions were modeled using pair-wise particle-particle interactions. In simulations of miscible fluid flow, particles with variable, composition dependent, masses and viscosities were used. Artificial surface tension effects were avoided by basing the SPH equations on the particle number density.},

	abstract = {The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method was used to simulate multiphase flow in fractures with complex geometries. Originally developed for astrophysical problems more than 20 years ago, SPH is now finding applications in hydrogeology. The fully Lagrangian nature of SPH allows the front separating the fluids to be modelled without employing complex front trucking schemes. SPH does not require the construction of a grid that would introduce numerical dispersion. The surface tension and fluids wettability are simulated by attractive and repulsive fluid-fluid and fluid-boundary interparticle interactions. The fracture geometry was generated from self-affine fractal surfaces. The fractal model is based on the observation that the fracture of brittle materials, including rocks, generates surfaces that have a self-affine fractal geometry, which can be characterized by a Hurst exponent with a material independent (universal) value of about 0.75. Our model qualitatively predicts such complex multiphase flow phenomenon as phase separation and fluid fragmentation. Such behaviors are very difficult to model with grid-base methods. A detailed comparison between numerical results and laboratory experiments is needed to quantitatively validate the model.},
